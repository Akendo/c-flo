# c-flo

MsgFlo setup for the c-base space station

## Participants

c-base has several artifacts communicating over the MQTT network. These are represented in MsgFlo-land as "dummy participants" loaded from definitions in the `participants/` folder.

To document any missing artifacts, please amend the definitions there. See [participant discovery](https://github.com/msgflo/msgflo#participant-discovery) for format documentation.
